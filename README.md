### Overview

Mongo Scraper is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. Mongoose and Cheerio are used to scrape news from another site.

The app will scrape stories from a news outlet and display them for the user. Each scraped article will be saved to an application database. At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
